# Nintendo Switch Analysis
This project provides an analytical view of Nintendo Switch sales from its launch in 2017 through the end of 2024. Using Excel for initial data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard explores performance across regions and time periods while highlighting cumulative milestones, peak quarters, and long-term growth patterns.

The dashboard presents lifetime sales, regional distribution, and yearly growth rates through a combination of KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. It emphasizes the seasonal strength of Q4 sales, identifies 2020 as the peak year, and illustrates how performance stabilized in later years while still contributing to overall growth. Regional insights show clear differences in contribution, with the Americas leading followed by Europe and Japan.

This work was an opportunity to practice end-to-end data storytelling: preparing and cleaning sales data, applying Tableau calculations for growth metrics, and designing an interactive dashboard that answers key business questions in a clear and visually engaging way. Both the dataset and the packaged Tableau workbook are included in this repository for reproducibility and further exploration
